## Wine Quality prediction with the help of Linear Regression
 In this notebook, we will use data of red wine to predict the quality of wine. As a first step to start we will find the co-relation between different feature. We will use most effective features for Linear Regression to predict wine quality.
 
 As a perfomance matrix we will look at the R - squared, Adjusted R-squared and accuracy of model.
